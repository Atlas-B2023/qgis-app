# Setting up QGIS
## Installing QGIS
To install QGIS, head to their website (https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and download version 3.34.0.
This can be installed anywhere on the device.
Once installed, head to AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default in your file explorer.
Delete the file called "symbology-style.db".
With that deleted, head over to this project and unzip sample.zip.
Copy the file called symbology-style.db from this folder, and paste it in the location where you deleted the other one of the same name.
